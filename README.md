# Overview
A terminal based chat made using sockets and threads. 

# Set-Up
After setting up the server, it returns an IPv4 in the terminal which can be used to help clients join that server and start texting. Clients run clients.py and can join the server. 

# Front-End
The use of Kivy was attempted though it was never completed due to other reasons. Front-end is hard ;(.
